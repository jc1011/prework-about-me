      <p>I like to learn new things, so I'm always obsessed with something new. Right now I'm deeply interested in the relationship between Generals Grant and Sherman during the Civil War. That's today's interest. I long ago stopped asking why something grabs me.</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I like coding. I love design and I love the problem-solving nature of coding. There is always a solution. Computers are very accomodating that way.</p>
